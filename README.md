The theme is a _child theme_ built upon
[Fitmas](https://wptf.themepul.co/fitmas/), a theme by
[themepul](https://themeforest.net/user/themepul).

## Detailed description


## Features

* Built on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for responsiveness and
  well-defined components

## Setup & Installation

First the parent theme, Fitmas, and then this child theme must be installed in
the `/wp-content/themes/` folder, directly under the Wordpress site's root
directory. The [Wordpress Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress) 
publishes detailed documentation on all aspects of Wordpress administration.

The Fitmas theme has many dependencies, and a detailed guide for further
development, thus it is advisable to refer to the official [Fitmas documentation](https://intro.themepul.com/fitmas/doc/) for a complete
installation and configuration guide.
